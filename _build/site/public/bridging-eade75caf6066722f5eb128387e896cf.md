# Bridging the Divide: Neighborliness and Belonging (Third draft)

**Our focus.** In a world more interconnected than ever, we often feel disconnected and estranged. Social media that was meant to bring us together pulls us apart. Once accepted facts are now disputed. Expertise is suspect. Institutions are fraying. In such a polarized world, how do we bridge divisions? Our project focuses on applying wisdom to polarization in a way that reflects Jesus’ response to the lawyer’s question, “*Who is my neighbor?*” (Luke 10:29b)
That question arose when Jesus taught to love one’s neighbor as oneself. Jesus responded with the parable
of the Good Samaritan, illustrating that a neighbor is anyone in need, even a perceived enemy or member
of a diUerent “tribe.” In our fragmented world, we find direction for bridge-building—not with the aim of
changing minds, but of loving all people as image-bearers of God.
