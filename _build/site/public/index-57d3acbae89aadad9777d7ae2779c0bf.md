# Neighborliness and Belonging: A Draft of What is Going On in Our Minds

This is a draft webpage. It doesn't intend to be a reliable material for anyone or any purpose. It is where we dump our thoughts, ideas, and reflections on the themes of neighborliness and belonging. Where we share our readings, videos and other resources that inspire us to think about these topics more deeply.
