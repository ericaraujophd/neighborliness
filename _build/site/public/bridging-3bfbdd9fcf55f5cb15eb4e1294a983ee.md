# Bridging the Divide: Neighborliness and Belonging (Third draft)

**Our focus.** In a world more interconnected than ever, we often feel disconnected and estranged. Social media that was meant to bring us together pulls us apart. Once accepted facts are now disputed. Expertise is suspect. Institutions are fraying. In such a polarized world, how do we bridge divisions? Our project focuses on applying wisdom to polarization in a way that reflects Jesus’ response to the lawyer’s question, “*Who is my neighbor?*” (Luke 10:29b)

That question arose when Jesus taught to love one’s neighbor as oneself. Jesus responded with the parable of the Good Samaritan, illustrating that a neighbor is anyone in need, even a perceived enemy or member of a different “tribe.” In our fragmented world, we find direction for bridge-building—not with the aim of changing minds, but of loving all people as image-bearers of God.

**Disciplines and Partners.** Fostering neighborliness requires virtues such as humility, curiosity, and empathy. Disciplinary perspectives can help identify the causes and consequences of polarization and suggest possible paths forward for ameliorating its harms. While biologists might point out the necessary polarization within living systems, philosophers, sociologists, and historians help us understand diverse human responses to the challenges of building community and sharing governance amid conflict. Artists, filmmakers, musicians, and writers create media that illuminate the human condition and provoke our social imaginations.

Learning to love and serve our neighbors also requires learning from other cultures. Calvin’s global reach enables us to approach neighborliness in an international way. The reading-group inception of this project invites further collaboration with scholars and churches in the Netherlands, a country with a tradition of
(Kuyperian) pluralism, as well as in Brazil and Ghana through networks cultivated by Calvin scholars.
